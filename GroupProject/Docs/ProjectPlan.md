## 1 Introduction
 
This application will assist job seekers in comparing job opportunities with customizable settings.
 
## 2 Process Description
 
 
### Requirements Engineering
 
#### Activity Description
 
In this phase, we define the necessary outcomes of the project, as communicated by the client.  These requirements are analyzed, organized, and validated to ensure that they are internally consistent.  The requirements must be organized for later review and possible future modification.
 
#### Entrance Criteria
 
* A client with a problem to solve
* A process for eliciting, organizing, and managing requirement
 
#### Exit Criteria
 
* Organized requirements documents, including descriptions which are internally consistent and fully capture the needs of the client
 
 
### Design
 
#### Activity Description
 
During this phase, software requirements are analyzed and translated into a description of the structure and organization of the project.  The specifics of the design documents vary across organizations, but they may include things like architectural design, abstract specification, interface design, component design data structures, and algorithm design
 
#### Entrance Criteria
 
* Requirements documents
 
#### Exit Criteria
 
* Design Considerations, Assumptions, and Constraints
* Architectural Design
* Component Diagram
* Low-Level Design
* Class Diagram
* User Interface Design
* Test Plan
 
 
### Implementation
 
#### Activity Description
 
In this phase, we will produce source code using the design documents as the guide. 
 
#### Entrance Criteria
 
* Design Considerations, Assumptions, and Constraints
* Architectural Design
* Component Diagram
* Low-Level Design
* Class Diagram
* User Interface Design
 
#### Exit Criteria
 
A software product which is feature-complete according to the specification
 
 
### Verification and Validation
 
#### Activity Description
 
In this phase, we check the software product to confirm that it meets the customer’s ends and is consistent with our requirements documents.
 
#### Entrance Criteria
 
* A feature-complete software product, according to the specification
* Design documents, including the test plan
 
#### Exit Criteria
 
* Software product with improved dependability
* Tests
   * Unit
   * Integration
   * System
* Results of testing
* Satisfactory fixes for faults found during the phase
 
 
### Maintenance
 
#### Activity Description
 
In this phase, we respond to software faults that have been discovered or modifications to the customer’s needs.
 
#### Entrance Criteria
 
* A software product which has been implemented, verified and validated
* Newly identified faults or modified requirements from a customer
 
#### Exit Criteria
 
* Software product with improved dependability and/or modified features
* Documentation of any modified requirements
